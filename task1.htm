<h1> WHAT IS HTML</h1>
<p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:</p>
  </body>
</html>
